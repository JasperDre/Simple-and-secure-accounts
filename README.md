## Usage
Until we reach [version 1.0](https://github.com/JasperDre/Simple-and-secure-accounts/milestones) the module won't have an interface or full security. However, most features are currently supported or at least partially implemented.

The default user from `sql/secure_accounts.sql` contains these values:
- Username	: `testuser`
- Email	: `tester@test.com`
- Password	: `Test123`
